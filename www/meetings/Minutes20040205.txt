 5. F2F Update

5 responses so far. ÊPlease let Marc know ASAP.


 6. ServiceFactory and service.createCall() issues

 See:

http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0402&L=jsr-224-
 eg&F=&S=&X=374899347C433866FF&P=260

 Action Item: sunil to look into JSR 109 spec restrictions

sunil/russell think a table would be useful, no dissention

We discussed what the table should contain and Marc will create it.

Action Item: ÊMarc will create a table

Informal poll: Ê(Russell will send a note specific to this poll so it
doesn't get lost in these minutes) does any vendor return a configured
Call object in loadService(Class)?

We will continue this discussion next week.

 7. Proposal for Handlers

 See Russell's post to the EG mailing list - the archives are acting up
 at the moment so I've uploaded the proposal to:

https://jsr224.dev.java.net/proposals/JAXRPC_Handlers.pdf

Russell asked, "should we even have handlers in JAX-RPC at all?" ÊMarc
thinks we still do because we've already created a DII-like call object,
so one objection - that you cannot get handlers in a DII environment -
goes away.

Richard began presenting the proposal. ÊDiscussed protocol agnostic
handlers. ÊDo they deal with Java objects or XML? ÊRichard presented a
preference to Java objects. ÊMarc suggested protocol agnostic handlers
AND protocol specific handlers and there was some discussion about
whether or not that is appropriate. ÊWe will continue this discussion
next week. ÊFor next week, focus on sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.3
