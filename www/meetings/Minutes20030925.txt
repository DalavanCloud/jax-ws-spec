- Other EGs:

This JSR is tightly linked to sever others:

JSR 222 (JAXB): Russel, Chavdar, Sunil, Dennis, Bjarne all either in the
JAXB EG or closely monitoring. JSR 181 (WS Metadata): Manoj is
monitoring, we want to align with the work in this JSR JSR 109 (WS for
J2EE): Sunil asked about the plan for 109, will it be updated to align
with JAX-RPC 2.0 ?

ACTION: Russell to talk to Jim Knutson and report back on future plans
for JSR-109.

6. Goals, non-goals, requirements

JAXB

We want to push data binding into JAXB. The customization mechanism in
JAXB will be made available, we won't expose a new one.

Manoj: JAXB doesn't talk about SOAP types. How are we going to deal with
SOAP types then?

Marc: I have a non-goal of support for SOAP encoding, postpone
discussion of this till we get to that.

Chavdar: Good idea to leave serialization support to JAXB. It avoids
duplication.

Dan: What's the timeline for JAXB 2.0?

Marc: Similar to JAX-RPC, dependency is one way from JAX-RPC to JAXB.

Dan: Concern about a JAXB 3.0 after a JAXB 2.0 and future interactions
between the JSRs.

Marc: Not aware of any plan for JAXB 3.0 immediately after that.

Bjarne: Is backward compatibility a goal?

Marc: It's currently listed as a non-goal. Currently JAX-RPC and JAXB
use different bindings; if we require backward compatibility, we end up
with two data bindings. It should be possible to customize the binding
and recover the previous mapping.

Roberto: In the context of J2EE 1.5, we'll have to support J2EE 1.4
apps, which use JAX-RPC 1.1.

SOAP 1.2

Add support for SOAP 1.2; keep supporting the 1.1 versions.

Prasad: Would MTOM be in scope?

Marc: Unclear when it'll be finalized. Can't hold JAX-RPC to wait for
MTOM if it's delayed.

WSDL 1.2

Add support for WSDL 1.2. The next working draft will be called "WSDL
2.0".

??: What's the timeline for WSDL 1.2?

Roberto: I expect recommendation in the second half of 2004. The
abstract portion is quite firm, although there are some new features
being discussed (e.g. service references).

Marc: You can only remove things from the spec after CR.

WS-I BP 1.1

Technical work is done, but discussions at the board level on how to
publish it. Don't expect a schedule problem with it.

Sunil: We need to support 1.1. We also want better support for 1.0. Also
the ability to step outside of the BP envelope.

Marc: By default we expect to get BP 1.0 conformance.

ACTION: Sunil to send mail on his "outside the BP envelope" requirement.

No call next week because it conflicts with a JCP event.

Meeting adjourned.
