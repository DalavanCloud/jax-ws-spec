2. Agenda Review and AOB

no other business


3. Approval of Feb 5th telcon minutes

See https://jsr224.dev.java.net/meetings/Minutes20040205.txt

Minutes approved


4. Review action items

See https://jsr224.dev.java.net/

* Glen to circulate alternate proposal for dealing with protocol  
specific fault information on client and server side - pending
* Marc to circulate example of using JAXB with DII - done
* Marc to think about how faults fit in with DII - pending

Sunil: Action item: sunil to look into JSR 109 spec restrictions 
for service factory and service.createCall() - done


5. ServiceFactory and service.createCall() issues

Sunil: got more comments on chapter 2
Mark: send them in an email

Roberto: 
 - createService() is intended for the DII APIs (row 1&2)
 - loadService() is intended for the static generated 
   clients (row 3,4&5)
 - Generated clients, depending on the implementation, may or
   may not contain WSDL information needed to populate the 
   call object. So it is better to leave it to the vendors to
   decide whether a Call object created using a loadService()
   is configured or not.
 - Option B (Binding only) is vague, so it must be either 
   C(configured) or U (unconfigured)

Manoj: loadService(Class sei) is wrong, it must 
be loadService(Class si) 

Sunil: It is not clear what must happens, if loadService(Class si)
is called on a service generated from a WSDL that contains multiple 
services

Manoj: What about splitting the Factory into two. CallFactory for 
creating Call Object (with all createCall(...) methods in Service) and
ServiceFactory to create static clients.

Mark: One more factory, will add to the confusion. 

Everyone: approved Roberto's proposal 

6. Call2 API

Sunil: To use invoke(Element) user need to put lot of generated classes
in the classpath. So we need to move invoke(Element) to Call3.

Mark: splitting the API will not help solve ClassNotFound errors.
Generated classes are only needed if invoke(Element) is used.

Dennis: JAXB can also be used with user written Java classes. They may
not extend JAXB Element interface. In this case invoke(Element) is not
enough.

Dennis: Using JAXB for XML binding is important, but it is not clear
whether people will prefer/use DII or generated static client.

Mark: Headers and Attachments can be set on the context that is passed
in to the invoke(). Handlers can then do protocol specific conversion on
header/attachment.

Mark: JAXB can be used to bind Faults. So if a binding is available,
then user can get the JAXB bound object from the exception. If not they
can get to the data.

Mark: If there are any comments on Chapter 2, please email the group.

Mark: Next week telcon will discuss handler framework.
