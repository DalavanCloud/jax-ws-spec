and https://jsr224.dev.java.net/drafts/javadoc20040520.zip



Chap 1:

Glen:
 - Odd to call this spec JAX-RPC, since it deals more with message
exchange than RPC.
Marc:
 - True, but JAX-RPC is well known to developers.
Roberto:
 - We must think about a new expansion for RPC. 

Chap 2:

Manoj:
 - WSDL 1.1 to Java mapping is written with regard to client stub
generation. The same mapping is also applicable to server side, but the
spec does not talk about it. 


Sec 2.3.1.2 line 26:
Manoj:
 - If there is a header part then the operation is not considered to be
a wrapped style. 
Marc:
 - This is same as JAX-RPC 1.1


Section 2.3.3 Figure 2.1 line 37
Manoj:
 - setLastTradePrice() must return SetLastTradePriceResponse


Section 2.3.4.6 Fig 2.2 line 4
Manoj:
 - (!response.isDone) must be (!response.isDone())


Section 2.5 Fault
Manoj:
 - Fault mapping is different from 1.1. JAX-RPC 1.1 tries to map Fault
inheritance hierarchy.
Marc:
 - True, but this is a simpler mapping and requires less types to be generated. Will add a note saying that the mapping is different from 1.1 and asking for feedback


Section 2.5.1 line 29
Manoj:
 - constructor order must be string, cause, faultInfo
Roberto:
 - it must be: string faultInfo, cause
Sunil:
 - need a constructor without cause
Marc:
 - will add this constructor

Chap 3:


Section 3.4 line 18
Manoj:
 - 2.0 only define document wrapped case. There are many use cases where
the user needs to control the schema. In this case un wrapped is better
than wrapped.
Glen:
 - start with WSDL is one good use case
Marc:
 - add a note saying only wrapped is supported for now and asking for feedback.


Section 3.8.1 line 17
Manoj:
 - Spec says that the soap binding style must be document. We need to
support RPC literal?
Marc:
 - will add a note requesting feedback on this question
Sunil:
 - Do we have to support soap encoding?
Marc:
 - 2.0 spec does not require nor describe how to do soap encoding, it is ok for a vendor to support it but that would be using 1.1 spec not 2.0.
Glen:
 - Interop using soap encoding is not a big a problem.

Chap 5:
Sunil:
 - ordering of handler is not clear - split over two sections
Marc:
 - will see if this can be improved

Section 5.4.1.1
Sunil:
 - more properties like operation name can be added to the standard
properties.
Marc:
 - will add a note saying that more standard properties may be added and asking for suggestions

Marc:
 - Will hold another meeting next week to gather any additional feedback prior to sending spec to JCP for publication.
