6. DII Enhancements

(6.1)  Roberto's proposal (SAAJ/DOM/JAXB related):

http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0401&L=jsr-224-eg#6

Roberto explained the proposal.
Got email feedback on been consistent on using Element/SoapElement.
Roberto ok with removing the soap-ness whenever possible.


(6.2)  Marc's new proposal:

http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0401&L=jsr-224-eg#1

Roberto described the proposal.
Sunil: drastic proposal, we need to think about it more if it's going to
replace the old DII API.
Kevin: old one would be unchanged.
Sunil: keep the changes defined last week, then add new ones.
Sunil: we need to support WSDL 1.1 rpc/encoded.
Roberto: but do we need to support asynchrony?
Sunil: we're discussing this internally.
Decided to discuss it more over email and solicit internal feedback.


(6.3)  Sunil's DII enhancements proposal:

http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0401&L=jsr-224-eg#11

Discussion moved to next week.


(6.4)  Russell's observations:

http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0401&L=jsr-224-eg#3

Russell: call object is not really DII, we shouldn't call it that, it's closer to portable stubs.
Roberto: closer to dynamic proxies; have a hard time picturing a case that is not
covered by the proposed Call.invoke(Element) or dynamic proxies.
Russell: how many people are really using the call object?
Kevin: used the call object for doc/lit with WSDL.
Roberto: it's a resource allocation problem for the expert group really.


http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0401&L=jsr-224-eg#4

Russell: IBM's implementation is doing (2).
Sunil: we do (2) as well.
Roberto: is (2) logical? it's not implied by the signature of the method.
Doug: the RI is doing (2) too.
Roberto: choice is between deprecating it altogether and clarifying that it's a shorthand for calling setOperationName and invoke.


http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0401&L=jsr-224-eg#5

Russell: deprecate the old call and create a new, better one.
Roberto: I'd be more comfortable if we knew how many problems the existing call really has, but it seems that the more we investigate it, the more issues we uncover.
Discussion on creating a new call and reserving the existing one for legacy uses.
Need to think about this path more.


7. Java->XML mapping and JAXB binding customization

The JAXB 2.0 expert group is currently discussing the issues involved in
translating Java classes to and from XML.

Dennis's email at:

http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0401&L=jsr-224-eg#15

Dennis: it was discussed in the JAXB concall on Tuesday and got a favorable reception.

Add action item to Dennis to write something up on linking the JAXB and JAX-RPC frameworks.
