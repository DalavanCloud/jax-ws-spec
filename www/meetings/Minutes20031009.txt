a.	JSR 181 and JAX-RPC
i.     Russel: two specs defining web service annotations.

ii.     Russel: rewrite Java-WSDL mapping section of the V2 goals

c.	Messaging

i.     Russel: Too much messaging is not in scope for V2, ok with explanation posted to EG mailing list.

d.	J2SE

i.     Russel: ok with the explanation posted to the EG mailing list.

e.	Session Management

i.     Dennis: Similar to .Net based of HTTP cookies, or SOAP Headers
ii.     Marc: Which SOAP header? There are no standard SOAP headers yet.
iii.     Marc: V2 will define high level APIs without going in to the details of transport/protocol bindings.

f.	1.1 Issues

i.     Russel: May not be in the goals.
ii.     Marc: will go through issue posted and work out which to add to bugtraq on our website and which to add as requirements.

g.	Async Operations

i.     Sunil: Only client side support?
ii.     Sunil: Polling v/s callback?
iii.     Sunil: correlation ID?
iv.     Sunil: can send a proposal next month.

h.	List of Non-Http transports being planned

i.     Sunil: What all transports? Ð JMS, SMTP
ii.     Sunil: prefer JMS
iii.     Sunil: V2 APIs must not have any direct dependency of HTTP.

i.	Relationship with JSR 208

i.     Sunil: Question whether JAX-RPC 2.0 would the standard client
 interface to a 208 defined provider or not? At this time, we don't
 have a position and we want to defer it until we hear the official
 stmt. on the relationship between with 208 & 224.
ii.     Marc: (action item) contact 208 spec lead
iii.     Sunil: V2 must not define soap headers but only APIs and properties.
iv.     Marc: agrees.

j.	Session Management

i.     See e, above.

k.	Enhanced support for Security

i.     Marc: JSR 183 is delayed for 104/105
ii.     Marc: not sure when it will be get going
iii.     Marc: transport level security is enough?
iv.     Jim: No API support in V1 to get to transport level details
v.     Marc: something we need to look at when we address the goal to improve the transport separation, will capture as a requirement.

l.	Support for Reliable Messaging

i.     Sunil: need APIs/properties for RM
ii.     Sunil: can post proposal in a month
iii.     Marc: RM can be done through handlers
iv.     Marc: RM can be a good use case for handlers.
v.     Marc: So RM is not listed as a goal.
vi.     Chavdar: RM/sessions etc, needs to maintain state.
vii.     Roberto: V1 client stubs are already statefull due to properties.
viii.     Marc: V2 must deal with stateful service, related to session support discussed above.

m.	Enhanced Header apis (setHeader/getHeaders/clearHeader rt. al.) on Stub/Call object

i.     Sunil: V2 must have user friendly APIs to access/modify headers
ii.     Sunil: Header apis will accept/return header values as un-typed DOM.
iii.     Russell: Headers for different protocols have different requirements. (eg: actor, mustUnderstand, for SOAP)
iv.     Marc: property sharing between stub/handler will reduce the need for header APIs.

n.	Enhanced Custom Serializer support

i.     Sunil: This is part of JAXB?
ii.     Marc: Yes, but serializer may not look same as V1, leave details to JAXB EG, define contract between JAXB and JAXRPC.

o.	Backward binary compatibility of runtime implementations

i.     Sunil: J2EE 1.4 ear/war file must be deployed on a server that supports V2 without modification.
ii.     Marc: this is a J2EE level requirement
iii.     Marc: V2 must not do anything that breaks this requirement.
iv.     Marc: (action item) will split this into goal and non-goal.
