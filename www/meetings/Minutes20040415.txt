2. Agenda Review

No changes to the agenda.

3. Approval of minutes

No objections. Approved.

4. Review action items

See https://jsr224.dev.java.net/

- (PENDING) Roberto and Marc to send out a written proposal for a server
side provider interface, similar to Dispatch on client side
- (PENDING) Marc to see if a F2F can be done in June with JAXB, if not
then, July
- (PENDING) Roberto will summarize discussion on JAXB
UnmarshallingException capabilities
- (DONE) Marc/Glen will start a mailing thread on keeping the
JAXRPContext as parameter or set it as a property of a Dispatch?

5. JAX-RPC / JBI Relationship

We'll be discussing a bit more the proposed relationship between JSR 208
and JSR 224. Support materials are at:
http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0404&L=jsr-224-eg&X=27F5484E4F66162521&P=4039

Roberto: Any more  comments on the proposal?
Sunil: We prefer slides 1 & 2. Better clarification of System Handlers
and Users Handlers and also between Application and Endpoint (port) Handlers
Richard: Isn't the latter a JSR 109 issue?:
Sunil:   Yes and No. As per DD, yes, but when it comes to API, are we
planning to have set handlers on Service, Port, Binding etc...

No more questions.  Defer until API and Class changes happen.

6. Handlers proposal

The discussion will then naturally drift into the handlers proposal.
The latest version of the proposal is at:
http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0403&L=jsr-224-eg&X=27F5484E4F66162521&P=3036
Some other handler-related email threads:

Richard: Base Handler may not fit all models
Roberto: Doesn't? it, even if Base Handler is abstract?
Richard: Current SOAP Handlers are  very RPC centric?
Sunil: Why?
Richard: Bcoz of handleRequest/handleResponse
Roberto: It looks more close to R-R MEP, but also addresses one-way MEP.
Roberto: We could include Message Label
Roberto: I was leaning towards the old packages, but not anymore
Richard: We got things wrong with package names in 1.1
                    a) Leave it alone and live with it
                    b) Make changes now and correct them
                Lets get them correct
                    Handlers -> RPCHandlers
                    MessageContext is general, leave it
Richard: Don?t see a need for Generic Interfaces
Roberto: Basically are you saying keep the old legacy stuff and create a
new set of classes/interfaces/packages?
Richard: Not advocating it, just listing issues/options
Richard: Current Handlers are nothing but RPC Handlers. Message-style
Handlers is outside the scope of JAX-RPC and should be defined some
where else and we should refer to it and build it on top of it.
Richard: Notion of a SOAP Message Handlers makes it less usable than
SOAP RPC Handlers and need it consider this when developing this feature
as J2EE 1.5 is meant to be simple and usable.


Richard:  I took an AI @ F2F to design HandlerRegistry at Binding/Port,
and Service. For that I introduced HandlerInfoBinding. So though they be
defined at different scopes, they act all on the same port as one
logical chain.
Sunil:      What is the difference between PortProtocolBinding and
ProtocolBinding?
Richard: There will be only one instance (Singleton) of the
ProtocolBinding for each Protocol and PortProtoclBinding will reflect
the binding instance bound to that Port.
Robert:    Why doesn?t ProtocolBinding extend HandlerInfo?
Richard:   Because it should be done on PortProtocolBinding
Roberto:  Couldn?t it be set on the logical PortBinding itself?
Richard:   We could consider it, but what value add will it have?
Roberto:  JBI could only implement Protocol Handlers

Agreed to continue discussion on this on email.

Meeting adjourned.
