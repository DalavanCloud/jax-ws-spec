/**
 * {@add The definition of this annotation is only partly defined in this release of JAX-WS as
 * there is no standard way to convey its meaning via a WSDL.
 * A future release of JAX-WS will provide that standard mechanism to convey the meaning
 * of this annotation via a WSDL.  An implementation MAY indicate via WSDL, in a non-standard
 * way, the meaning of this annotation.  The runtime behavior of this WSDL is well-defined
 * in this release of JAX-WS.}
 * <p>
 * This feature represents the use of WS-Addressing with either
 * the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding.  Using this feature
 * with any other binding is NOT required.
 * <p>
 * {@delete Enabling this feature will result in the
 * <code>wsaw:UsingAddressing</code> element being added to the
 * <code>wsdl:Binding</code> for
 * the endpoint and in the runtime being capable of responding to
 * WS-Addressing headers.}
 * <p>
 * The following describes the affects of this feature with respect
 * to be enabled or disabled:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> ENABLED: In this Mode, Addressing will be enabled.
 *       {@delete If there is not a WSDL associated with the Endpoint and
 *       a WSDL is to be generated, it MUST be generated with the
 *       wsaw:UsingAddressing element.} At runtime, Addressing headers
 *       MUST be consumed by the receiver and generated by the
 *       sender even if the WSDL declares otherwise. The
 *       mustUnderstand="0" attribute MUST be used on the Addressing
 *       headers. 
 *  <li> DISABLED: In this Mode, Addressing will be disabled
 *       even if an associated WSDL specifies otherwise. At runtime,
 *       Addressing headers MUST NOT be used.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #required} property can be used to
 * specify if {@delete the <code>required</code> attribute on the
 * <code>wsaw:UsingAddressing</code> element should
 * be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>} {@add Addressing headers MUST
 * be present on incoming messages.  If this property is <code>false</code>
 * incoming messages MAY include Addressing headers}.  By default the
 * <code>wsdl:required</code> parameter is <code>false</code>.
 * <p>
 * See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-core-20060509/">Web Services Addressing - Core</a>
 * {@add and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-ws-addr-soap-20060509/">Web Services Addressing 1.0 - SOAP Binding</a> }
 * for more information on WS-Addressing.
