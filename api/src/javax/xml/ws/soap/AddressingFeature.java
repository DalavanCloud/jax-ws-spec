/**
 * This feature represents the use of WS-Addressing with either
 * the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding.  Using this feature
 * with any other binding is NOT required.
 * <p>
 * Enabling this feature on the client will cause the JAX-WS runtime
 * to include WS-Addressing headers in SOAP messages.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following describes the effects of this feature with respect
 * to be enabled or disabled:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> ENABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be enabled.
 *       At runtime, WS-Addressing headers
 *       MUST be consumed by the receiver and produced by the
 *       sender even if the WSDL declares otherwise. The
 *       mustUnderstand="0" attribute MUST be used on the response WS-Addressing
 *       headers. If a WSDL needs to be generated, it MUST contain a corresponding
 *       wsam:Addressing policy assertion.
 *  <li> DISABLED: In this Mode, WS-Addressing will be disabled
 *       even if an associated WSDL specifies otherwise. At runtime,
 *       WS-Addressing headers MUST NOT be used. WS-Addressing may be explicitly
 *       disabled to prevent a JAX-WS implementation from consuming and producing
 *       WS-Addressing headers. If an application
 *       has implemented WS-Addressing itself, it MUST explicitly disable this feature.
*        Not doing so may break compatibility with future versions of JAX-WS.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <code>required</code> property determines whether the endpoint
 * requires WS-Addressing. If it is set true, WS-Addressing headers MUST
 * be present on incoming messages. By default the
 * <code>required</code> property is <code>false</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the web service developer has not explicitly enabled this feature,
 * corresponding WSDL's wsam:Addressing policy assertion is used to find
 * the use of WS-Addressing.
 * If addressing is enabled, a corresponding wsam:Addressing policy assertion
 * must be generated in the WSDL as per
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-addr-metadata/#wspolicyassertions">3.1 WS-Policy Assertions</a>
 * 
 * @see Addressing
 * @since JAX-WS 2.1
