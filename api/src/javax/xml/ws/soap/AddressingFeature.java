/**
 * This feature represents the use of WS-Addressing with either
 * the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding.  Using this feature
 * with any other binding is NOT required.
 * <p>
 * {@delete Enabling this feature on the server will result in the
 * <code>wsaw:UsingAddressing</code> element being added to the 
 * <code>wsdl:Binding</code> for 
 * the endpoint and in the runtime being capable of responding to
 * WS-Addressing headers.}
 * <p>
 * Enabling this feature on the client will cause the JAX-WS runtime
 * to include WS-Addressing headers in SOAP messages.
 * <p>
 * If the web service developer has not explicitly enabled this feature,
 * it MAY be automatically enabled if the associated WSDL enables
 * WS-Addressing {@delete via the <code>wsaw:UsingAddressing</code>} {@add
 * with an implementation recognized WSDL extension} element{@delete with
 * the <code>wsdl:required</code> attribute set to <code>true</code>}.
 * {@add However, in this version of JAX-WS, there is no standard WSDL 
 * extension that a client can rely on to automatically enable WS-Addressing,
 * nor is there a standard default value specified for wsa:Action headers.}
 * <p>
 * {@add To write a portable endpoint and its corresponding client with this version of JAX-WS,
 * an endpoint MUST explicitly specify what <code>wsa:Actions</code> are to be used via the }{@link Action} {@add and }
 * {@link FaultAction} {@add annotations.  The client MUST explicitly enable addresssing via this
 * <code>AddressingFeature</code>, and for each invocation, the client MUST explicitly set the }
 * {@link BindingProvider#SOAPACTION_URI_PROPERTY}.
 * {@add After the W3C WG on WS-Addressing has specified how the use of WS-Addressing is specified in the WSDL,
 * and what the default value must be for Action headers, a future version of JAX-WS will remove these requirements.}
 * <p>
 * See {@link javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature} for more information 
 * on required WSDL extensions.
 * <p>
 * The following describes the effects of this feature with respect
 * to be enabled or disabled:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> ENABLED: In this Mode, {@add WS-}Addressing will be enabled. 
 *       {@delete If there is not a WSDL associated with the Endpoint and
 *       a WSDL is to be generated, it MUST be generated with the 
 *       wsaw:UsingAddressing element.} At runtime, {@add WS-}Addressing headers
 *       MUST be consumed by the receiver and {@delete generated}{@add produced} by the
 *       sender even if the WSDL declares otherwise. The
 *       mustUnderstand="0" attribute MUST be used on the {@add WS-}Addressing
 *       headers.
 *  <li> DISABLED: In this Mode, {@add WS-}Addressing will be disabled
 *       even if an associated WSDL specifies otherwise. At runtime, 
 *       {@add WS-}Addressing headers MUST NOT be used.  {@add WS-Addressing may be explicitly
 *       disabled to prevent a JAX-WS implementation from consuming and producing
 *       WS-Addressing headers. If an application
 *       has implemented WS-Addressing itself, it MUST explicitly disable this feature.
*        Not doing so may break compatibility with future versions of JAX-WS.}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #required} property can be used to 
 * specify if {@delete the <code>required</code> attribute on the 
 * <code>wsaw:UsingAddressing</code> element should
 * be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>} {@add WS-Addressing headers MUST be present
 * on incoming messages.  This property only has meaning when used on the
 * endpoint and has no affect when used on the client}.  
 * By default the
 * <code>{@delete wsdl:}required</code> {@delete parameter} {@add property} is <code>false</code>.
  <p>
