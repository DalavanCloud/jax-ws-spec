/**
 * This class encapsulates a HTTP request received and a 
 * response to be generated in one exchange. It provides methods 
 * for examining the request from the client, and for building and 
 * sending the response. 
 * <p>
 * The typical life-cycle of a HttpExchange is shown in the sequence
 * below. 
 * <ol><li>{@link #getRequestMethod()} to determine the command
 * <li>{@link #getRequestHeaders()} to examine the request headers (if needed)
 * <li>{@link #getRequestBody()} returns a {@link ReadableByteChannel} for reading the request body.
 *     After reading the request body, the channel is closed.
 * <li>{@link #getResponseHeaders()} to set any response headers, except content-length
 * <li>{@link #sendResponseHeaders(int,long)} to send the response headers. Must be called before
 * next step.
 * <li>{@link #getResponseBody()} to get a {@link WritableByteChannel} to send the response body.
 *      When the response body has been written, the channel must be closed to terminate the exchange.
 * </ol>
 * <b>Terminating exchanges</b>
 * <br>
 * Exchanges are terminated when both the request Channel and response Channel are closed.
 * Closing the WritableByteChannel, implicitly closes the ReadableByteChannel (if it is not already closed).
 * However, it is recommended
 * to consume all the data from the ReadableByteChannel before closing it.
 * The convenience method {@link #close()} does all of these tasks.
 * Closing an exchange without consuming all of the request body is not an error
 * but may make the underlying TCP connection unusable for following exchanges.
 * The effect of failing to terminate an exchange is undefined, but will typically
 * result in resources failing to be freed/reused.
